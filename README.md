### Challenges
 * Turning the json that is coming from the network requst was the challenges I faced.
 * Getting the data that is coming from the api to work without throwing a null and type error was hell. 
 * I'm still trying to add the search and filter functionaility. 

The other boss challenge is juggling the tasks with other commitments (❁´◡`❁).
